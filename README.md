<h1>Image Segmentation from OCT Scans</h1>

Our eyes contain numerous tiny blood vessels in the retina, known as retinal capillaries. These capillaries release a specific fluid, and the buildup of this fluid can lead to the development of cysts. Our objective is to identify these retinal cysts in retinal images, specifically OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) scans, using image segmentation techniques.


<h2>Project Overview</h2>
In this project, we utilize deep learning techniques, specifically a variation of the U-Net architecture, to perform image segmentation on OCT scans. Image segmentation is a computer vision task that involves partitioning an image into multiple segments to simplify the representation of an image into meaningful information.

<p>
We employed a modified U-Net architecture, a popular deep learning model for image segmentation tasks. The U-Net architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder, allowing for precise localization of features while also taking into account the global context of the image.
