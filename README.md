# IMAGE-SEGMENTATION-FROM-OCT-SCANS

Our eyes contain numerous tiny blood vessels in the retina, known as retinal capillaries. These capillaries release a specific fluid, and the buildup of this fluid can lead to the development of cysts. Our objective is to identify these retinal cysts in retinal images, specifically OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) scans, using image segmentation techniques.
